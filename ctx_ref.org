* The ctx Object

ctx is passed into each enter and exit function on the listener.

On it, you can get rules that are sub elements of the current rule by calling that sub-rule as a function:
eg: in 'enterG_package', ctx.name() will get the name rule, then calling 'getText()' will get the 
text that encompasses that subrule.

The same goes for Tokens, eg: 'ctx.TYPE()'. 

For cases where there are multiple elements of a token/rule,
the getter will return an array. eg: 'ctx.TYPE()[x]'

You can specify a particular element to get. eg: 'ctx.TYPE(0)'

The methods that can be defined are enter[rulename] and exit[rulename].
CAPITALISATION IS IMPORTANT. capitalisation will be preserved, with the addition of the first letter after enter 
and exit being capitalised.
eg: rule 'name' will become 'enterName' and 'exitName';

sub-elements of the ctx will exist or be NULL
